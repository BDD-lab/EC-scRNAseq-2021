# EC-scRNAseq-2021
ScRNAseq analysis for Decoding the molecular landscape of the developing spatial processing system and production of entorhinal stellate cell-like cells by a direct programming approach.

The bioinformatics analysis is broken into 4 part, corresponding to the first 4 main figures:
1. Figure 1: Merging, clustering and analysis of entire dataset: xxx.R
2. Figure 2: Subclustering and analysis of inhibitory interneurons: xxx.R
3. Figure 3 Subclustering and analysis of oligodendrocytes: xxx.R
4. Figure 4 and 5A: Subclustering and analysis of intermediate progenitors and excitatory neurons: xxx.R

The datasets generated and used for the analysis are available at the NCBI repository with GEO accession number [GSE134482](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE134482). The submitted data includes the raw sequencing data as fastq files together with the processed count matrix used in this study.
